# You Are Beautiful When You Are You

Most of our couples start by saying, *"We are awkward in front of cameras."* Trust us, you are not awkward; you just aren't used to having a lens pointed at you for hours!

At Nikah Photography, our style is candid and unobtrusive. However, during the couple portraits, we do guide you. Here is how to prepare mentally.

## 1. Ignore the Camera

Easier said than done, right? But the best photos happen when you focus on your partner. Look into their eyes, hold their hands, fix their collar. When you interact with each other, your smile becomes genuine.

## 2. Movement is Key

Static poses can feel stiff. We often ask our couples to:
*   Walk slowly towards us.
*   Dance a little.
*   Whisper a joke to each other.

Movement allows your clothes to flow and your posture to relax naturally.

## 3. Trust Your Photographer

We know the angles. If we ask you to tilt your chin or move your hand, it's because we want the light to hit you perfectly. Trust the process.

## Conclusion

Your wedding day is about celebration, not performance. Relax, breathe, and let us handle the rest.
